# Dependencies and Environment Management

## Using pipenv

The program dependencies can be loaded using the [Pipfile](https://github.com/BuzzKanga/MLZoomcamp-2023-Mid-Term-Project/blob/main/Pipfile) and [Pipfile.lock](https://github.com/BuzzKanga/MLZoomcamp-2023-Mid-Term-Project/blob/main/Pipfile.lock) files.

All the librbaries need to recreate the environment can be installed by copying the [Pipfile](https://github.com/BuzzKanga/MLZoomcamp-2023-Mid-Term-Project/blob/main/Pipfile) and [Pipfile.lock](https://github.com/BuzzKanga/MLZoomcamp-2023-Mid-Term-Project/blob/main/Pipfile.lock) files into the project folder and runnning the command:  
`pipenv install`



To start the virtual environment, the following command can be run:  
`pipenv shell`

## Using requirements.txt

An alternative way to set up the environment is use the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/BuzzKanga/MLZoomcamp-2023-Mid-Term-Project/blob/main/requitements.txt) file.  

This is done by running the following command:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
